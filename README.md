A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Firebase setup

This project includes basic Firebase configuration. Update the generated
`lib/firebase_options.dart` file with your own project credentials or run
`flutterfire configure` to create it automatically. Google service files for
Android and iOS are already present in `android/app/google-services.json` and
`ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`.
